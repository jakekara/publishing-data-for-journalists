# Publishing data with journalists in mind

**Please interrupt.**

# Part 0 - What I do
1. Explain your data in plain English
2. Make nifty presentations ([Bail](https://jakekara.github.io/pretrial-slider/), [ECS](http://projects.ctmirror.org/content/trend/2016/10/excess_cost/), [Budget](https://jakekara.github.io/budget_petri/))
3. Deal with stuff I don't understand, at first

# Part 1 - You seek publicity
1. Reputable source?
2. Good methodology? Show me the data! So I can...
   1. check your math;
   2. understand your process;
   3. find  new angles and write more stories or make fancy graphics;
   4. use your data later on for an unrelated story later on;
   5. know that next time you send me something, it'll be worth looking at
3. Relevant information?
4. Do I have time to deal with this? Embargo!

# Part 2 - I stumble on your data
1. Reduce weirdness
   1. Weirdness: Non-obvious limitations of the data (I.E. you only uploaded half your spreadsheet)
2. When weirdness can't be avoided, make it obvious

# Part 3 - Examples
1. DECD data ([Data](https://data.ct.gov/Business/Small-Business-Express-Tabulated-Data/565g-b4i4))
2. CDC teen birth rates
