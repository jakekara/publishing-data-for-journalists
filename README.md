# Publishing data with journalists in mind

#### "It's 11 p.m., do you know where your data are?"

You might only think about us journalist when you're trying
to draw attention to your work, such as releasing a press release to
accompany a study you've completed.

But people will keep finding your data when they're trying to answer
questions you may have never considered.
