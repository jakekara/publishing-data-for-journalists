# Part 0 - What I do
1. Explain your data in plain English
2. Make nifty presentations ([ECS](http://projects.ctmirror.org/content/trend/2016/10/excess_cost/))
3. Deal with stuff I don't understand, at first

# Part 1 - You seek publicity
1. Reputable source?
2. Good methodology? Show me the data! So I can...
   1. check your math;
   2. understand your process;
   3. find  new angles and write more stories or make fancy graphics;
   4. use your data later on for an unrelated story later on;
   5. know that next time you send me something, it'll be worth looking at
3. Relevant information?
4. Do I have time to deal with this? Embargo!

# Part 2 - I stumble on your data
1. Goal: Data that stands on its own
2. Reduce weirdness
   1. Weirdness: Non-obvious limitations of the data (I.E. you only uploaded half your spreadsheet)
3. When weirdness can't be avoided, make it obvious

# Part 3 - Examples
1. DECD data ([Data](https://data.ct.gov/Business/Small-Business-Express-Tabulated-Data/565g-b4i4), [Story](http://trendct.org/2016/05/13/incentive-program-behind-on-audits-but-ahead-on-jobs/))
2. CDC teen birth rates ([Story](http://trendct.org/2016/12/02/teenage-pregnancy-rates-continue-to-decline-in-connecticut/))

# Part 4 - Data structure whining
1. Summary stats mixed with raw data
2. Excel formatting
3. Formula hell ([Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Es89IcP9hXe_3QwgZf7UqAR1Vac0-1VD2AtluhJtfI4/edit#gid=1784818844), [graphic](http://projects.ctmirror.org/content/trend/2016/10/excess_cost/))
